### 1) "Before starting, I would like to point out how cool the idea is! First of all, it is a very convenient "tool" for the whole university, both for professors and students, because it saves time and nerves from paperwork. Secondly, I liked this project because it fits perfectly into the current age of technology. In particular, we young people are used to everything happening at the touch of a finger and to having technology in front of us, not paper. So I saw only pluses, and it would be cool if this project would be implemented in the future. Fatima Bakmamatova and Natalia Klimarenko from COM19 did a great job!  I'm proud of my seniors!"

### 4) "As for me, it is a very convenient application, I like the opportunity to reserve books, and not worry that you will not get them. I also think that it will be easier for librarians to keep track of the availability of books in the library and their timely return from students."

### 6) "In my opinion , it is an amazing application.As I am the student of this university , I really liked this library application. It gives us chance to get the book that we are looking forward. And also saves many time to librarians and also to the readers. And we can easily know how many there books, instead of going to look. Totally I really appreciate this work."

### 8) "That's gotta be the best project I've ever seen in com19. Comparing what we've been taught and what you've done, I can confidently say that this is very impressive. Of course, it's not too close to real development, but taking into consideration the fact that you're doing custom DBMS for uni, I'm pleasantly surprised with your progress."
